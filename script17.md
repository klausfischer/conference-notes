## JavaScript is a buffet, not the enemy - [Chris Heilmann](https://twitter.com/codepo8)

- [Video & Blog article](https://scriptconf.org/blog/javascript-is-a-buffet-not-the-enemy-chris-heilmann/)
- [Slides](http://www.slideshare.net/cheilmann/javascript-is-a-buffet-scriptconf-2017-keynote)
- Use the right tools for the right job (avoid HTML markup in JS)
- Analogy to buffets (only take what you can eat)
- Your environment != your users environment
- Share what makes you happy!
- Find something you are excited about - do it first!
- Try something new!
- Experiment with fetch API and Service Workers, it pays off
- Don't necessarily touch things you don't like
- Know the basics
- Question your biases
- Think about collaboration (you are not alone)
- Less code is easier to maintain, but keep it readable
- Demand learning time in the company (the fast nature of our industry)

### Open source
- Improve the code you use (open source contributions)
- Don't just submit an issue, maybe try to fix it in a pull request
- Create useful services for other people
- Explain in detail on what you rely and why
- Don't block others out
	- No ridiculous old browser support
	- Don't rely on broken APIs
	- Check `if` browser APIs are available, otherwise include polyfills
	- Different environments - different solutions (Browser != Node)

## Evolution of a web application - [Raquel VÃ©lez](https://twitter.com/rockbot)

- Story of npm's website and the challenges when building it
- Early very basic version launched (better release ANYTHING than nothing)
- Slow/inefficient search was a recurring problem (guys from [npms.io](https://npms.io/) built a solid one and now provide the search as a service for [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/))
- After searching, people went straight to github, simply because the readme wasn't visible on top --> npm showed it more prominently
- People didn't know about the npm products (private packages, organization-wide registry, npm enterprise)
- Fundamentally changed the website, promoted the products --> instant increase of customers
- Rewrote the whole website several times :)
